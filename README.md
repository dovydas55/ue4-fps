# Unreal Engine 4

#####Rules:
- DO NOT FORGET TO BUILD THE PROJECT EVERYTIME YOU PULL FROM GIT!!! OTHERWISE THE UE4 WILL CRASH OR START MISBEHAVING!!!!!
- The referance images (for map design) can be found inside Plans folder
- DO NOT forrget to reference everything regarding the project! All referances should be stored appropriately in Resources.txt file
- ALL downloaded material should be stored in Downloads folder before importing it into UE4 (for backup)
- .gitignore file exludes all of the trash, therefore do not be afraid to commit often :D 

#####Command line FTW:
- Crouch => left ctrl
- Zoom in => right click
- bullet drop 

#####Command line FTW:
- git status
- git add fileName (also -A -U)
- git commit -m "message goes here"
- git reset --soft HEAD~1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<<<this will undo your last commit
- git reset --hard &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <<<also hard reset, undo all of your changes
- git push -f origin HEAD^:master &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <<<this command will delete last "push" that was pushed onto github!!
